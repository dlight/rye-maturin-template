# What this is

This is a template code extracted from [Rye's
templates](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/tree/ce3c91a8353044b3fb978162b90cb7c1b1a89868/rye/src/templates),
more specifically the template generated by [`rye init my-project
--build-system maturin`](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/rust/).

I just added something to make it an executable package, rather than a library,
and added a .pyi file to have Maturin output work with Pylance and other Python
LSP servers.

## How to run

First run

```sh
rye sync
```

Then run

```sh
rye run my-project
```

You should see this output:

```
Hello from my-project!
```
